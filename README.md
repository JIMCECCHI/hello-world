Hello-World sample repository for doing tutorials began 12/28/17 by Jim Cecchi
My name is Jim Cecchi; I am 59 years old and have been on Social Security Disability for over 15 years and I am also a Vietnam Era
veteran with a service connected disability.
I have gotten better and year by year a little more functional again and last year for the first time
in 15 years went back to work part-time.
